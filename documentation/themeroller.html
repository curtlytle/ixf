				<h2>Pick a color, any <span style="color:red">c</span><span style="color:orange">o</span><span style="color:yellow">l</span><span style="color:green">o</span><span style="color:blue">r</span>. <span class="text-xs">(please don't actually pick any of those colors)</span></h2>
				<p>Not all of them will look great. But hey, at least it's at least a place to start.</p>
				
				<p>The IxF uses lots of CSS gradients to reduce image requirements. Because of that it is easy to update the theme of the site via CSS as well. This page allows you to pick a base color and then we create the lighter and darker colors for you. Yes, we just like you that much.</p>

				<p>After finding your happy color, click the button below to get the CSS that you should put in your project.css. The URL for this page is updated to reflect whatever color you have chosen. So you can bookmark or send it to that special someone.</p>

				<p><a href="" id="theLink" class="ixf-button primary">Get your custom CSS</a></p>
				<h2>Things to know</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>All this does it update the outer chrome colors and the popups. The colors for components like forms, buttons, tabs, etc are fairly neutral and will work with many colors. If you need those to change, you are on your own.</li>
					<li>The pointer part of the popups will not update colors on the fly like everything else.  They are built using canvas and is based off the color of popup border when the popup first opens.  To see them update as well you will need to refresh.</li>
					<!-- <li>The background image in the subheader will not work for all (most?) colors. You will likely want to make a version customized to your own colors.  <a href="http://design/ixf/downloads/subnav.psd">Here is a psd source file</a>. But for quick previews, the current version gets the idea across.</li> -->
					<li>You will need to change the color of the little circle in the top right of the nav yourself. We wanted to keep this simple and have you only pick one color.</li>
				</ul>
