		<p>In addition to all the features outlined in the <a href="../demo/tables.html">Demos &amp; Examples</a> section of this site, the IxF supports a number of general functions that are essential to almost any application.</p>

		<h2>Flexible App Size</h2>
		<p>The IxF allows for both a full screen app (like what you see here) and a smaller, fixed app frame for <a href="../layout/small.html">smaller types of apps</a> (like simple registration screens, etc.). It also features an <a href="../layout/small2.html">alternate look</a>.</p>

		<h2>App Menu</h2>
		<p>Seen as a dropdown where it says &ldquo;Interaction Framework&rdquo; at the top of this page, this menu is used for quickly switching between different apps that are part of the same suite. This falls into the <a href="../intro/philosophy.html">philosophy</a> breaking large apps into smaller apps and grouping them as part of a suite instead. It should not be the only way to switch between related apps but should complement another page/site that does the same thing.</p>

		<h2>App Tools</h2>
		<p>Seen as a &ldquo;Messages&rdquo; and &quot;My Options&quot; menus at the top right of the screen, this area can be used for global app tools like setting preferences, signing out, global notifications, global search (via a dropdown) etc.</p>

		<h2>Navigation</h2>
		<p>A scalable navigation scheme is built on a PHP framework that helps quickly develop prototypes. Based on the navigation init file in the <a href="../intro/kickstart.html">KickStart</a> project, an IxF project can have no menu or first and second level navigation as needed. If localization creates a longer menu than expected, the top level menu is built to wrap without breaking the layout.</p>
