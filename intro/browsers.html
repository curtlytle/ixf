			The IxF has been built out with a few things in mind.
			
			<ul>
				<li>We want to look forward, not backward.</li>
				<li>All browsers don't need the exact same experience</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>With those things in mind, here is how known browsers stack up.</p>
			
			<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>IE 8</strong> - Some styles aren't available here, but functionality all works.</li>
				<li><strong>FF 3.6 </strong>- Windows and Mac</li>
				<li><strong>Safari 5</strong> - Specifically on the Mac side, but if it works on the Mac, 99.9% of things will work on Windows.</li>
				<li><strong>Chrome</strong> - Windows and Mac</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Browsers coming soon</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>IE 9</strong> - Significant changes from previous versions (for the better). Will fully support it when it comes out, but may take a little work to get it flushed out after its release.</li>
				<li><strong>Firefox 4</strong> - No anticipated issues.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Unsupported Browsers</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>IE 7</strong> - IE7 is over 4 years old (released Oct 2006) and is very costly to support. If you must support this browser, the IxF may not be the best option for your project. That being said, we are taking steps to make the IxF at least functional in IE7. Things may look vastly different, due to various CSS related issues, but you should be able to still read what you need and submit a form.</li>
				<li><strong>Opera</strong> - According to our omniture stats, Omniture consitutes about 0.2% of our traffic on public sites, 0.1% internally.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h></h>
			<h3>IE7 Specific stuff</h3>
			<p>IE7 is down to</p>
			<ul>
				<li>10% globally, dropping .5% per month</li>
			</ul>

			
			<h4>IE7 Issues</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Form layout doesn't work very well. Basically all forms will be stacked.</li>
				<li>The "Fixed Header" on tables causes issues, so these are not applied.</li>
				<li>Occasionally form fields show on TOP of the actionbar</li>
				<li>Grid will cause horizontal scrollbar when going 100% wide and when there is a vertical scrollbar. IE7 does not compute widths with the scrollbar in mind. So scrollbar will show and last few pixels have the potential to need to be scrolled to.</li>
				<li>Tables go wider then they should. Seems similar to the scrollbar math from above.</li>
				<li>Heights of panels get computed wrong. Get changed as you scroll down. The height being given to the ixf-panels/ixf-panel elements seems to be causing this. Not sure why the layout demo site doesn't have issues though.</li>
			</ul>
